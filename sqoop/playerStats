There is no primary key for the player_stats table.
The primary key that can be considered is (Map, Match_id), but that is not viable in sqoop import as we have to mention 2 columns which is not possible.
We cannot use split-by also because there is no single column which contains unique elements.
So we will have to use 1 mapper only which would create only 1 file in warehouse directory and no parallelism

sqoop import \
--connect jdbc:mysql://quickstart.cloudera:3306/counterstrike \
--username root \
--password cloudera \
--table player_stats \
-m 1 \
--warehouse-dir /user/cloudera/counterstrike/
